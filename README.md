# web-scraping-challenge

## Mission to Mars

Used pandas and splinter to navigate 5 web sites.

The web sites were first investigated using Jupyter Notebook.  The pages were opened and scraped using BeatifulSoup.  Relevant data was printed in the notebook.

MongoDB and Flask templating were used to create a new page displaying data that was scraped from the 5 web sites.
